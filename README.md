#Team6 Augmented Reality Artificially Intelligent Art

The aim of this project is to create a mobile app which utilises Augmented Reality (AR) and IBM 
Watson to create a unique piece of interactive art and facilitate a richer art appreciation 
experience. We have created a painting, accompanying AR effects that can be viewed through our app, 
and an IBM Watson Assistant chatbot in the app that takes on the persona of the painting. 
The chatbot answers questions about the paintingâ€™s artist, content, and meaning, and also 
answers questions about how the chatbot works. IBM wanted us to develop this as a 
proof-of-concept product to demonstrate how people could be given a better way to connect to and 
understand the meaning behind pieces of art, whilst utilising this engaging medium to demystify
AI for the general public and bring awareness of IBM Watson.

##File structure:

The main project files are found in app/src/main/java/team6/project:

Backend files:
1. TextToSpeechInterface.java - Java class acting as the JavaScript Interface between the 
   Chatbot WebView and the Text-to-speech service
2. StreamPlayer.java - Java class that converts and plays the Text-to-speech audio

Frontend files:
1. MainActivity.kt - Kotlin Activity class that is the entry point of the app, handles preloading
   the chatbot, camera permissions, and installing AR
2. PaintingWithArActivity.kt - Kotlin Activity class that handles the AR session, including
   detecting the painting and displaying the 3D AR animated model
3. PaintingNoArActivity.kt - Kotlin Activity class that handles the downgraded app experience for
   when AR is unavailable on the user's device, the user refuses to install AR, or they deny camera
   access
4. ChatbotActivity.kt - Kotlin Activity class that handles the Chatbot WebView which loads the
   chatbot.html file from the assets

Extras:

The IBM Watson Assistant html embed script (chatbot.html) is found in app/src/main/assets.
It connects to our IBM Watson Assistant instance and triggers the TextToSpeechInterface to play
its responses.

The layout file for the PaintingWithArActivity (activity_painting_with_ar.xml) is found in
app/src/main/res/layout.

An image of the painting (painting.jpg) is found in app/src/main/res/drawable. You can use it to
test the AR by pointing your camera at it.
