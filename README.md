# Team6 Augmented Reality Artificially Intelligent Art

## Overview:
The aim of this project is to create a mobile app which utilises Augmented Reality (AR) and IBM 
Watson to create a unique piece of interactive art and facilitate a richer art appreciation 
experience. We will create a painting, accompanying AR effects that can be viewed through our app, 
and an IBM Watson Assistant chatbot in the app that will take on the persona of the painting. 
The chatbot will answer questions about the paintingâ€™s artist, content, and meaning, and also 
answer questions about how the chatbot works. IBM would like us to develop this as a 
proof-of-concept product to demonstrate how people could be given a better way to connect to and 
understand the meaning behind pieces of art, whilst utilising this engaging medium to demystify
AI for the general public and bring awareness of IBM Watson.
